                    KODANDA RAMIREDDY WAS NO ORDINARY FARMER. At 26, he had an MBA degree and wanted to change the
                    farming techniques and methods used in his village. His family jointly owned around 20 acres in
                    Rayampalli village in Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur district. They had taken several loans – an
                    agricultural loan, an educational loan from a bank and other loans from private moneylenderse
                    family’s land, and Ramireddy was in the process of retrieving it from the private moneylenders. He
                    needed to pay off the money his family owed the bank. Only then could he sell two acres of their
                    land and repay those loans owed to moneylenders. His parents had mortgaged the family’s land, and
