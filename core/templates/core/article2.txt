The cow's 'sons' are praying in the fields


The cow's 'sons' refers to the farmer and the bullock in one of the six ovi in this edition of the Grindmill Songs Project on PARI. These songs, by Phulabai Bhong of Nimgaon Ketki village in Pune district, speak of anxiety due to a lack of rain and the joy that rainfall brings

The verses in this instalment of the Grindmill Songs Project tell us what it is like when it doesn't rain and how it feels when it does. The performer, Phulabai Bhong, sings memorable and hummable melodies in her deep voice.

She starts by telling Meghraja (the Rain King) that he did well by falling and pouring out of the sky the way he did because the bullock could drink water from the small rain-water filled furrow near the plough – the animal, it is implied, did not have to go to the pond source to quench its thirst.  

Phulabai then sings that Megharaja has embellished the sky with a black mare – that is, a black cloud that portends rain. Seeing this black mare, the earth goes wild with joy. 

The third song uses the earth-rain pairing as a comparison to a woman and her husband. The singer tells us that just like the earth has no lustre without rainwater, a woman has no importance without a husband. This line in the ovi indicates the social status of women in rural India (and across most parts of India), where a married woman is given more respect than one who is unmarried or a widow.

When there is no timely rain, Phulabai asks Megharaja, "what is in your mind?" She sings that the sons of the cow – the farmer and the bullock – are both praying for rain in the fields. When there is not a drop of rain, the whole world worries and these sons of a cow have no choice but to fast.  

In the sixth and the last ovi, the singer describes how good it is when it does rain. Phulabai addresses Meghraja and says that when the god pours water into the fields and everywhere, she is very happy because then the young offspring of man and sheep are able to quench their thirst.

Meghraja, you pour and pour, you did well to pour now
My young Raghoba's bullock drank water from the furrow near the plough

Meghraja, you pour, you create a black mare 
He decorated a black mare, the whole earth became wild with joy

No rain, no water, the soil has no lustre
Without a husband, the woman has no standing

There is not a drop of rain, what do you have in mind
The cow's sons are both praying in the field

There is not a drop of rain, the whole world is worried
The cow's sons are compulsorily fasting

Meghraja, you pour water in the fields and everywhere
How much can I tell you O woman, farmer and sheep both have young ones

Note: The singer is telling a neighbour that she is so happy that the young offspring of farmer and sheep have water to quench their thirst.
